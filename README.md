# Mastermind

I created a command-line Mastermind. The user is allowed to play as the code creator or the code breaker. The user and computer has 12 chances to solve the code.

## Update 1

When the user is the creator, the computer randomly generates possible code guesses until it runs out of moves or correctly guesses the user's code.
